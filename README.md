1) Name - Monali Milind Mhetre

2) Programming language - Python 2.7

3) How the code is structured?  
- The data is read from the specified text file.
- This data is then represented as a graph.
- After representation by graph, paths from source and destination is found out along with their corresponding weights and the path with the minimum weight is selected.For this Uniform Cost Search algorithm is used and generated optimal path.
- Lastly, the path from source to destination city along with their distances is displayed as output on the screen in the expected format.

4) How to run the code?  
- Type the following command to execute the program from command prompt:  
     ```	python find_route.py 'input1.txt' 'Bremen' 'Kassel'   or    python find_route.py 'input1.txt' 'London' 'Kassel'	```

Note: The arguments are case sensitive and the code has been tested on omega's default compiler
.
